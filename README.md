# CSS Animation Follow-up: Monster in a Box

![Monster in a Box Animation](assets/monster_in_a_box.gif)

## Project Overview

This is a hands-on CSS animation project where students build a mysterious creature animation from scratch. The project focuses on creating a "Monster in a Box" scene where a creature trapped inside occasionally pries open the walls to peek out with glowing eyes.

## Learning Objectives

Students will practice:
- **HTML Structure**: Building semantic markup from scratch
- **CSS Positioning**: Using relative and absolute positioning effectively  
- **CSS Animations**: Creating coordinated keyframe animations
- **Project Workflow**: Planning, building incrementally, and testing progressively
- **Problem Solving**: Breaking down complex animations into manageable pieces

        └── solution.html       # Complete solution
```

## What Students Will Build

The final animation includes:
- **Centered Scene**: A bordered container that frames the animation
- **Opening Walls**: Two wall sections that slide apart to create a crack
- **Monster Fingers**: Dark appendages that grip the crack edges and extend as it opens
- **Blinking Eyes**: Mysterious glowing orbs that appear and blink when the crack widens
- **Coordinated Movement**: All elements animated together in a smooth 12-second loop

## Teaching Approach

This is a **build-from-scratch** project designed to reinforce:
1. **Progressive Development**: Students work through 7 checkpoints, building one feature at a time
2. **Independent Problem Solving**: Minimal starter code forces students to think through structure
3. **Real Development Workflow**: Planning → Building → Testing → Refining
4. **Animation Coordination**: Learning to synchronize multiple animated elements

## Difficulty Level

- **Level**: Intermediate
- **Estimated Time**: 90 minutes
- **Prerequisites**: Basic HTML, CSS positioning, and CSS animations knowledge
- **Skills Focus**: Project planning, CSS keyframes, element coordination

## Getting Started

Students should navigate to the `lab/` directory and follow the detailed instructions in the lab README. Each checkpoint builds upon the previous one, with reference images provided to verify progress.
